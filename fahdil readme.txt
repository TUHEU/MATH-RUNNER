# 🎮 MATH RUNNER

## 📌 Project Overview
**MATH RUNNER** is a 2D educational adventure game developed in **Python (Pygame)**.  
It combines **fun gameplay mechanics** with **mathematical problem-solving** to make learning engaging and interactive, enhanced with **face-emotion detection** to adapt question difficulty based on the player’s emotions.  

Players must **run, dodge obstacles, and solve math equations** that appear dynamically. Correct answers help them progress, while mistakes or delays make the game more challenging.  

This project was created as part of our **End of Summer 2025 Exams**.
